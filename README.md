Background 

This notebook explores a dataset from kaggle, detailing roughly 10 years of weather observation from 50 different cities in Australia.

The cities included vary greatly in weather characteristics, with locations in harsh desert climates such as Alice springs included as well as 
humid tropical locations in the top-end. 

The goal of the project was to use only today's weather to predict if it will rain tomorrow. 

The most accurate model tested ended up being a random forest classifier. I will continue to update this model, and plan to update it with a voting
classifier to see if I can increase the accuracy of the model.
